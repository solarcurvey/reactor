# BUILD REPORT — Issue #3 route candidate integrity

**Status:** Indexer quote-ticket atomicity on protocol 0.3.2 (main includes #19 BIGINT, #20 media keys, #26 signer fail-closed).  
**Not audited. Not mainnet.**  
**Architecture / economics / 3.5% / curve / Top-10 / Keeper routing / Factory V1 constants: unchanged.**

## This HEAD

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Protocol release | **0.3.2** (`docs/version.json`) — **unchanged** |
| Factory | **V1** — **unchanged** |
| Intent | Keep selected route and atomic preview/`minOut`s from the same candidate (`Fixes #3`) |
| Indexer / lib | `quote-integrity.test.ts` + `pnpm --filter indexer test` |
| Mainnet | **Blocked** |

## Closed this run

| Leftover | Closed? | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `quote-service` mix of `bestPreview` (max `finalOut`) with a differently scored `pickBest` route | **Yes** | `quote-select.ts` binds the whole `PreviewRoute` to the pickBest winner. Routing-hop outs/kinds (`plannedHops`) are split from the terminal official/bonding slot (`plannedHops + 1`). BUY and SELL regressions decode `PreviewRoute`. Foundry `previewBuy`/`previewSell` assert `hopOuts.length == hops.length + 1`. |

# Prior — Protocol 0.3.2

**Status:** Continue on existing REACTOR Origin repo. Parent `9f29527` (#20 media key/URL on #19 BIGINT, Factory V1).  
**Not audited. Not mainnet.**  
**Economics / 3.5% / curve / Top-10 / Keeper routing / Factory V1 constants: unchanged.**

## Prior HEAD (0.3.2)

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Protocol release | **0.3.2** (`docs/version.json`) — one coordinated bump (#19 BIGINT + #20 media + #26 signer) |
| Factory | **V1** (`FACTORY_VERSION = 1`, immutable) |
| Intent | Isolated pricing signer fail-closed when the durable store is unavailable (issue #2) |
| Foundry | Unchanged from 0.3.1 (**326 passed**) — no contract edits |
| Indexer / lib | `pnpm --filter indexer test` includes `pricing-signer-store.test.ts` + `media-r2.test.ts` + `pnpm docs:check` |
| Mainnet | **Blocked** |

## Closed this run

| Item | Closed? | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `openStore().catch(() => undefined)` signer bypass | **Yes** | `openSignerStore` + `requireDurableStore`. `SIGNER_STORE_UNAVAILABLE` → 503 |
| Receipt consume + issuance bucket skipped without store | **Yes** | `consumeDurableAdmission` always runs before EIP-712. Missing `id` refused |
| Health without store | **Yes** | Isolated signer `/health` requires `durableStore()` |
| Regression tests | **Yes** | `apps/indexer/src/pricing-signer-store.test.ts` |
| Launch Admission / Trust Model docs | **Yes** | `LAUNCH_ADMISSION.md`, `docs/admission.md`, `docs/trust.md`, `THREAT_MODEL.md` |
| Postgres INTEGER overflow on `Date.now()` ms | **Yes (main #19)** | Schema v6 `BIGINT`. Kept in this 0.3.2 changelog |
| R2/S3 key = public `/m/<id>.webp` | **Yes (main #20)** | `mediaObjectKey` / `assertMediaKeyMatchesPublicUri`. `media-r2.test.ts` |

## Still blocked (do not fake)

| Blocker | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Public mainnet (5042) | Hard blocked. No addresses. |
| Independent Codex / professional audit | Not performed. Do not claim audited. |
| Top-10 as onchain oracle | Frozen offchain by design. |
| Arc Factory claimed | No funded `ARC_TESTNET_PK` in this environment. |

## EIP-170 sizes

Unchanged from 0.3.1. Factory **stays V1**.

| Contract | Runtime (bytes) | Gate |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| ReactorFactory | **23,286** | ≤ 23,552 **pass** |

## Honest gaps that remain

- Unix-seconds INTEGER columns still hit the year-2038 wall on Postgres. Not this P0.
- LOCAL Turnstile bypass when secret unset (explicit LOCAL only).
- Funding-parent is a heuristic (ASN + /16 + optional first-USDC-funder).
- Factory runtime must stay under the CI margin.

Mainnet blocked pending Codex + audits + KMS/Safe rehearsal.
